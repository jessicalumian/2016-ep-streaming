This will be converted to markdown. Steps to generate streaming data:

1. Fire up Amazon EC2 (m3.xlarge for data subset)
2. Install git-core for literate resting text extraction
of khmer-protocols. Commands:

sudo chmod a+rwxt /mnt
sudo apt-get -y install git-core

3. Extract commands from protocols, note ctb branch is nonstreaming. Commands:

# note - for nonstreaming, do -b ctb, for streaming, do -b jem-streaming
cd /home/ubuntu
rm -fr literate-resting khmer-protocols
git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/literate-resting.git
git clone https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer-protocols.git -b ctb

cd khmer-protocols/mrnaseq

4. Extract commands from protocals. Commands:

## vim 1-quality.rst # change version number on line 49 to match the release to test

for i in [1-3]-*.rst
do
   /home/ubuntu/literate-resting/scan.py $i || break
done

5. In another ssh session, run sar to monitor resrouces. Use screen to do so in same window. Screen commands:

screen
crtl+a n # creates new window

Sar commands:
# Install

sudo apt-get install sysstat -y

# Run
sar -u -r -d -o times.dat 1

crtl+a crtl+a # go back to previous window

# check to make sure this works
for i in [1-3]-*.rst.sh
do
   bash $i
done

7. Use scp to transfer file to local computer (instead of cyberduck). Command for local computer:

scp -i ~/Downloads/amazon.pem ubuntu@<Public DNS>:/mnt/work/trinity_out_dir/Trinity.fasta ~/2016-ep-streaming
